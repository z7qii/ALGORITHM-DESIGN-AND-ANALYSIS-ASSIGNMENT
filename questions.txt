ask her about question 1 data set 1

when you say Record the time to insert all data into the priority queue. 
Dequeue the data to test the timing of the priority queue. do you mean just to record the time of sorting ??

when you say plot the graph of timing vs dataset size do you want to to draw the graph or plot the graph by code ?


in question 4 :

when you say i cannot go back to home station, do you mean i cannot revisit any visited station or i cannot revisit the previous station ?

should i start from A ?

can i visit a station without including it ? for example let say the want to go to station c and i am at station a, and there is a path exists from a => b => c 

can go from a to b to c and just add c to the stations set or every station that i pass through i need to inculde ?
